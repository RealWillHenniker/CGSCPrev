                    <p>The competitive swimming pathway through the club consists of eight squads progressing from 4 hours training per week up to 17 hours. These eight squads are split into two distinct sections; Swim Skills (SSK) and Train to Compete (TTC). This pathway aims to introduce key training concepts and strategies at the optimal time within a child’s maturation and development to achieve their full competitive potential. The pathway focuses on long term success and is based on the Athlete Development Support Pathway and Youth Development model as indorsed by Swim England and British Swimming. Movements between each squad are at the coach’s discretion.</p>

                    <p>In this introductory squad, swimmers are introduced to some basic coaching drills aiming to
                    develop an understanding of how they are able to move their body’s in different ways with
                    control.
                        Competitions to enter: <br/><br/>

                    <br/>Four seasons – 25m and 50m events (coach will select races)<br/><br/>
                    These events are chosen for a gentle and friendly introduction to competitive swimming.
                    For the remaining SSK squads 200m events should be the priority as success in these events
                    require a high level of stroke skills whereas success in 50m events is often influenced more by
                    physical size rather skill.</p>

                    <p>Swimmers are now required to train on a Saturday morning, this is their first taste of an
                    aerobic training session and will start to use training skills such as using the pace clock for
                    turnaround times. Swimmers in this squad are expected to have all four legal strokes so that
                    they are able to begin entering open meets. Their focused event is 200IM. This squad will
                    now begin land training as a supplement to the swim programme. Land training at this early
                    stage aims to develop flexibility, stability, core strength and kinaesthetic awareness, thus
                    improving movement patterns and stroke technique when they swim. All training sessions
                    are conducted by professional, qualified and highly experienced strength and conditioning
                    coaches.

                    <p>Swimmers in this squad will be refining stroke drills and practices to improve the efficiency
                    of each stroke. Training will become steadily more progressive, increasing the swimmer’s
                    aerobic capacity. By working with this core component of fitness, the swimmer’s ability to
                    maintain skill over distance will be improved. Land training will still be focused on
                    fundamental movement patterns to assist in the development of stroke technique.
